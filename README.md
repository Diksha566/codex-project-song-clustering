## Solution 
- Data Collection and Preprocessing: Collect a diverse dataset of song lyrics.
Preprocess the lyrics by removing stop words and punctuation.

- Feature Extraction: Convert preprocessed lyrics into numerical

- K-Means Clustering: Choose the number of clusters (K) using methods like the elbow method.
Apply the K-Means algorithm to group songs based on lyric similarities.
